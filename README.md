This python notebook includes the script accompanying the article: Hawkins et al. (2021).
The script in this notebook was used to run the simulations representing the scenarios in that article. 
The LivSim model was developed and is under continued improvement by the plant production systems group at Wageningen University. 
That model can be accessed from here: https://git.wur.nl/Zijls004/livsim
